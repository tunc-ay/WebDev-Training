# What is Netsparker?

Netsparker is an automated, yet fully configurable, [web application security scanner](https://www.netsparker.com/online-web-application-security-scanner/) that enables you to scan websites, web applications and web services, and identify security flaws. Netsparker can scan all types of web applications, regardless of the platform or the language with which they are built.

Netsparker is the only online web application security scanner that automatically exploits identified vulnerabilities in a read-only and safe way, in order to confirm identified issues. It also presents proof of the vulnerability so that you do not need to waste time manually verifying it. For example, in the case of a detected SQL injection vulnerability, it will show the database name as the proof of exploit.

Our scanning technology is designed to help you secure web applications easily without any fuss, so you can focus on fixing the reported vulnerabilities. If Netsparker cannot automatically confirm a vulnerability, it will inform you about it by prefixing it with \'*\[Possible\]\'*, and assigning a Certainty value, so you know what should be fixed immediately.

## Key Concepts

> This is a list of key concepts in Netsparker.

|**Concept**     |  **Description**  |
|---|---|
|  Highly accurate  | Netsparker produces highly accurate web application security scans, whose vulnerabilities are verified, proving that they are not false positives.  |
| Proof-Based Scanningâ„¢  | Our Proof-Based Scanning technology actively and automatically verifies detected vulnerabilities, confirming that they are real and not false positives, by exploiting them in a read-only and safe manner. Depending on the type of vulnerability, Netsparker will generate proof. Some vulnerabilities also allow you to exploit them manually or generate a Proof of Concept.</br> It's completely safe. For example, when exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability and generating a proof of exploit for it, the scanners will only try to read data from the database, not write or delete data from the database.|
|Proof of Concept   | Netsparker identifies vulnerabilities, then it safely exploits them during the web vulnerability scan. This Proof of Concept is the actual exploit that proves that the vulnerability exists. And, it's useful if you need to reproduce the vulnerability for a developer. This is what an XSS vulnerability report looks like, where the Proof URL is what Netsparker uses to exploit the vulnerability.  |
| Proof of Exploit  | A proof of exploit is used to report the data that can be extracted from the vulnerable target once the vulnerability is exploited, demonstrating the impact an exploited vulnerability can have and proving that it is not a false positive. This is what it looks like in the case of an SQL Injection vulnerability.  |
| Vulnerabilities  | A vulnerability is a security weakness in your website or web application that provides an opening for malicious hackers to gain access, get access to data or exploit for illegitimate or illegal purposes.  |
| Issues  |  An Issue is the name, type, date and other details of any detected vulnerability. |
| Severities |  Each vulnerability is assigned a different severity or threat level according to the damage it could do and the urgency with which it requires fixing.|
| Scan Policies  | Netsparker allows you to use Scan Policies in order to determine and specify the type, range, and targets of your scan according to your needs.  |
| Scheduled Scans  | Scans can be launched immediately or they can be scheduled for times when it best suits you, including at regular intervals.  |
| Integrations  | Netsparker can work with and import or export information in conjunction with other security scanning tools.  |

## Benefits of Proof-Based Scanning^TM^ Technology

Here are some of the key benefits:

-   Users can be sure that detected vulnerabilities reported by
    > Netsparker detects are real, and not false positives, because each
    > report comes with a proof of the exploit

-   The exploitation of vulnerabilities is totally safe and read-only,
    > with no data written into or deleted from your database

-   Development teams can rely on the information you provide, since the
    > vulnerabilities and issues have proof, contain detailed
    > remediation information and are prioritised

-   You do not have to spend time manually verifying detected
    > vulnerabilities, so you can focus your limited resources instead
    > on fixing them

-   You do not have to employ seasoned security professionals, since
    > results are automatically confirmed, and there is no need to know
    > how to reproduce the findings

### [What is the Difference Between Netsparker Enterprise and Netsparker Standard?](https://www.netsparker.com/support/what-is-netsparker/#what-is-the-difference-betweeen-netsparker-enterprise-and-netsparker-standard)

[Netsparker Enterprise](https://www.netsparker.com/online-web-application-security-scanner/) is an online web application security scanner that is available On-Demand and On-Premises, and [Netsparker Standard](https://www.netsparker.com/web-vulnerability-scanner/) is a Windows desktop application.

For further information, see [Netsparker Standard and Netsparker Enterprise Comparison](https://www.netsparker.com/comparison-netsparker-cloud-desktop/).

#### Netsparker Crawling and Scanning Technology

Netsparker has [[industry leading scanning technology]{.ul}](https://www.netsparker.com/blog/news/comparison-web-vulnerability-scanners-netsparker/). Both editions are built around the same crawling and [[Proof-Based Scanning technology]{.ul}](https://www.netsparker.com/web-vulnerability-scanner/false-positive-free-web-security-scan/).

In terms of coverage, [detection of vulnerabilities and security flaws](https://www.netsparker.com/web-vulnerability-scanner/vulnerabilities/), you get the same results.

#### Overview of Both Netsparker Web Application Security Scanners

The [[Standard edition of
Netsparker]{.ul}](https://www.netsparker.com/web-vulnerability-scanner/)
was built for those who are more hands on -- security engineers,
penetration testers and developers -- and scan typically less than 50
websites.

![](media/image3.png){width="6.5in" height="3.5555555555555554in"}

Netsparker Enterprise is a scalable, multi-user online vulnerability
scanner with built-in enterprise workflow and testing tools. Because it
is a browser-based cloud platform, you do not need to buy, license,
install or support hardware or software. You can also launch as many web
application security scans as you want within minutes.

#### ![](media/image4.png){width="6.5in" height="2.9444444444444446in"} {#section-1}

#### Scalability of Service

Scalability is the major difference between the editions. If you need to
scan multiple websites at the same time, you can manually launch
multiple instances of the Standard scanner. Alternatively, with
Netsparker Enterprise, you can scan thousands of websites at once.

##### Feature Highlight: Website Groups

Netsparker Enterprise enables you to group websites, configure generic
scan settings and launch or schedule a web security scan with a single
click.

#### Keeping Up with the Latest Web Security Threats

Follow our [[web application security
blog]{.ul}](https://www.netsparker.com/blog/) and you will notice that
we frequently release software updates. In fact, our [[list of
vulnerabilities
checks]{.ul}](https://www.netsparker.com/web-vulnerability-scanner/vulnerabilities/)
grows daily. Releasing frequent updates ensures that you can scan your
web applications against the latest security threats and
vulnerabilities. The response time for releasing new security checks is
also critical especially when a vulnerability such as Apache Struts is
discovered and being exploited in the wild.

-   Netsparker Standard checks for updates every time it is launched.
    > You can apply updates in minutes.

-   Netsparker Enterprise is maintenance-free. We update the service and
    > updates are automatically available.

#### Web Security Scanner Adaptability

Typically, desktop software is more configurable than an online service.
The reason is because an online service is built around an engine that
is designed to cater for a wider variety of customers. Therefore, it has
fewer configurable parameters, resulting in a number of limitations.

But, this is not the case with the Netsparker. Anything that can be
configured in Netsparker Standard can also be configured in Netsparker
Enterprise, such as the [[URL rewrite
rules]{.ul}](https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/url-rewrite-rules-web-vulnerability-scanners/)
and other crawling options, HTTP connection properties and other scan
policy settings.

#### ![](media/image6.png){width="6.5in" height="2.375in"} {#section-3}

#### Team Collaboration

-   Netsparker Standard is a desktop application that is designed for a
    > single user who has access to the computer on which it is
    > installed.

-   Netsparker Enterprise is a multi-user environment. Every team member
    > has their own user account in the Netsparker Enterprise edition
    > and with the right privileges can launch web application security
    > scans, view reports and issues. As an administrator, you can
    > configure different privileges for each user.

##### ![](media/image7.png){width="6.5in" height="2.013888888888889in"} {#section-4}

##### Feature Highlight: Vulnerability Management and Tasks

Just like dedicated bug tracking systems, Netsparker Enterprise enables
you to assign identified vulnerabilities as tasks to team members for
remediation. This is an essential feature when you are tracking the
security of many web applications.

![](media/image8.png){width="6.5in" height="6.736111111111111in"}

Tasks marked as Fixed (Unconfirmed) are automatically rescanned.
Depending on the result, they are either closed or reopened and
reassigned.

The vulnerability management system is designed to ensure every user
knows what they need to do, and for results and fixes to be checked
automatically. You can also integrate your existing bug tracking
solution.

#### Web Application Security Scans in Your SDLC

Both Standard and Enterprise editions can be easily integrated into your
SDLC and Continuous Integration processes.

-   Netsparker Standard has command line support allowing you to easily
    > write scripts that can be triggered by other applications to
    > launch automated scans.

-   Netsparker Enterprise has an extensive and well documented API that
    > you can use to trigger any type of action available in the
    > Netsparker Enterprise dashboard. In addition, it has native
    > plugins that allow for continuous integration with tools such as
    > TeamCity, Jenkins, Bamboo, GitLab and Azure that help to expand
    > Netsparker\'s capabilities.

#### Keeping Web Applications Secure

Launching a single web application security scan and remediating the
identified vulnerabilities can be quite difficult. It is even more
demanding to scan all web applications frequently and ensure that
detected vulnerabilities are fixed, and that the applied fixes do not
open new security flaws.

-   If you use Netsparker Standard, you can compare different scan
    > results on the same website. Our Retest and Incremental scans
    > allow you to pinpoint the differences between scans and keep track
    > of all issues. It\'s easy to compare results, but time consuming
    > if you have lots of websites.

-   This is where Netsparker Enterprise shines. Its trending and
    > correlated reports are automatically updated each time a website
    > or web application is scanned. This negates the need to manually
    > compare results.

#### ![](media/image10.png){width="6.5in" height="2.638888888888889in"} {#section-6}

#### Enterprise or Standard Web Application Security Scanner?

-   If you have a small team and a small number of websites, and you
    > prefer to be more hands-on, Netsparker Standard is the best
    > option.

-   If you operate in a large team and have many websites and web
    > applications to secure, and need supporting tools to ensure
    > collaboration among the team members, Netsparker Enterprise is
    > recommended. You will also have access to the Netsparker Standard
    > edition for each user.
